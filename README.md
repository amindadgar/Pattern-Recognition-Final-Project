# Patter-Recognition-Final-Project
This repository contains the codes implementation of my patter recognition final project. I have implemented some types of various SVM types. To read more about these types you can take a look at the *Paper Implementation Report.ipynb* Or read my [medium article](https://amindadgar.medium.com/various-types-of-support-vector-machines-in-machine-learning-3a09ca465850). <br>
## Running on your local machine
To re-run and see the outputs you can follow the commands below <br>
- Install pipenv on your system
- ```pipenv install -r requirments.txt```
